A2: Broken Authentication: This category covers issues related to authentication mechanisms, such as session management and password policies. JWT authentication is a mechanism to address these concerns.

A5: Security Misconfiguration: Ensure that your authentication mechanism, JWT secret, and other security-related settings are properly configured and not exposed.

A6: Security Logging and Monitoring: Properly logging and monitoring authentication and authorization activities, including failed login attempts and unauthorized access, is essential to detect and respond to security incidents.

A10: Insufficient Logging and Monitoring: As mentioned, logging and monitoring are essential for tracking and identifying suspicious activities related to authentication and authorization.




User Registration (registerUser):

Validates the request body using express-validator.
Checks for errors in the request parameters and returns a 400 response if there are errors.
Verifies if the user already exists in the database based on the provided email.
If the user does not exist, it creates a new user record in the database.
Hashes the user's password before storing it in the database for security.
Generates a JSON Web Token (JWT) for the newly registered user.
Returns the JWT along with user role and full name in the response.
User Authentication (authUser):

Retrieves user information based on the user's ID stored in the request object.
Returns the user's information in the response.
User Login (loginUser):

Validates the request body using express-validator.
Checks if the user exists based on the provided email.
Compares the provided password with the hashed password stored in the database.
If the provided credentials are valid, it generates a JWT for the user.
Returns the JWT along with the user's name and user role in the response.
User Retrieval (getUsers, getUser, getUsersByID):

Retrieves user information from the database.
getUsers: Retrieves a list of all users.
getUser: Retrieves a user by their ID.
getUsersByID: Retrieves a user by their full name.
User Update (updateUser) and Deletion (deleteUser):

Allows updating and deleting user records based on their ID.
Overall, this code provides user registration, authentication, and management functionality for your Express.js application. It also includes JWT-based authentication for securing routes and protecting user data.
